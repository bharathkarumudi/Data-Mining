a. If the term occurs in only one document, then it will have maximum weight.  
   If the term occurs in ever document, then it will have zero weight.
   
b. The purpose of this transformation is that the terms that ocuur in every document has no much significance to differentiate one document from another.

## 2. 

#### Setting up the Libraries and data
```{r Data Setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
Sales <- read_excel("Sales.xlsx")
```

### a. Sales by year and product in a stacked graph

```{r Q2a}
d1 <- Sales %>%
  select(year, category, product, amount) 

Sales_by_yr_product <- with(d1, d1[order(year),])

Q2a <- ggplot(data=Sales_by_yr_product, aes(x=product, y=amount, fill = year)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 10^8)
```

```{r Q2a Plot}
plot(Q2a)
```

### b. Sales by product in a pie chart

```{r Q2b}
Sales_by_product <- Sales %>%
  group_by(product) %>%
  summarise(amount = sum(amount))

Q2b <- ggplot(Sales_by_product, aes(x="", y=amount, fill=product)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=10^6) + 
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  labs(x="",y="Sales")
```

```{r Q2b Plot}
plot(Q2b)
```

### c. Avg. sales across the states in a bar graph

```{r Q2c}
avg_sales_state <- Sales %>%
  group_by(st) %>%
  arrange(country) %>%
  summarise(avg_sales = mean(amount))

Q2c <- ggplot(avg_sales_state, aes(x=st, y=avg_sales, fill=avg_sales)) + geom_col() + labs(x="State", y="Avg. Sales ($)")
```

```{r Q2cplot}
plot(Q2c)
```


### d. Sales comparision between states in 2013 and 2014 using faceting

``` {r Q2d}
d2 <- with(Sales, Sales[order(year, amount, state),])

Q2d <- ggplot(data=d2, aes(x=state, y=amount, fill=amount)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  facet_grid(~year) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 10^8)
```

```{r Q2d Plot}
plot(Q2d)
```


### e. 2013, 2014 month wise sales comparision - line graph

``` {r Q2e}
d3 <- Sales %>%
  select(mo, year, amount) 

d4 <- d3 %>%
  group_by(mo, year) %>%
  arrange(mo) %>%
  summarise(sales = sum(amount))


Q2e <- ggplot(data = d4, aes(x = mo, y = sales, group = year, colour=year)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = Sales$month) + theme(legend.position = "right",
        legend.title = element_blank()) 
```

```{r Q2e Plot}
plot(Q2e)
```

## 3. Multidimensional Cube

#### Building the cube on Product, Month, Year and State:
```{r Cube Setup}
mul_cube <- tapply(Sales$amount, 
                       Sales[,c("product", "month", "year", "st")], 
                       FUN=function(x){return(sum(x))})
```


### 1. Slice operation: compute the revenue for Laptop during January of 2013 in each state.
```{r Slice}
mul_cube ["Laptop", "Jan", "2013", ]
```

### 2. Dice operation: compute the revenue for the furniture products (Mattress and Chair) during the second quarter (April, May and June) of 2014 in each state.

```{r Dice}
mul_cube [c("Mattress","Chair"), 
             c("Apr","May","Jun"), 
             "2014", ]
```

### 3. Rollup operation: compute the annual revenue for each product and collapse the state and month dimensions.

```{r Rollup}
apply(mul_cube, c("year", "product"),
      FUN=function(x) {return(sum(x, na.rm=TRUE))})
```

### 4. Drilldown operation: compute the annual and monthly revenue for each product and collapse the state dimension.

```{r Drilldown}
apply(mul_cube, c("year", "month", "product"), 
      FUN=function(x) {return(sum(x, na.rm=TRUE))})
```
