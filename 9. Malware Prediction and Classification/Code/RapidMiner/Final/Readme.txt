/*Instructions documened below are for Rapid Miner end to end execution and process.*/
Please run the below RM processes in the order given below - 
1. ASM_Analysis_Opcode_Ngram.xml - This process enables to read the ASM files / Opcode N-grams on the ASM file collection.
		This process reads the ASM files distribution and does the following:
		1. Process documents from files in loop and parallize:
		(Double click Process Documents from files for subprocesses)
		(a) Tokenize the ASM files (feed the ASM Files in bulk)
		(b) filter the tokens based on opcode n-grams
		(c) Feed forward to generate attributes process
		2. Generate attributes for the metadata file name characteristic
		3. Select the attributes that are important (namely metdata file characteristics/Opcode n-gram) and 		write to CSV output for Feature selection and Modelling

2. ASM_File_Preparation.xml - This process prepares the attributes collected and analyse with trainingLabels provided to create the file for modelling.
		File Preparation steps:
		1. Combine the feature set file extracted (CSV) and trainingLabels files.
		2. Set the role for class as Label and utilize the Join Operator to create a feature rich dataset.
		3. Write to a CSV for intermediate output. This file contains utmost 10800+ records for each of the 		training dataset.
		4. Please take are in the repository locatio used in READ CSV and RETRIEVE DATASET.
		
3. ASM_Attributes_Modelling.xml - This process does basic classifiers for various modellign experitments as below on ASM n-gram Opcode.
		Modelling:
		1.Read the FINAL FEATURE dataset.
		2. Select the attributes.
		3. Convert Numerical Class to Polynominal/multivariate and set Role to Label for classification
		4. Remove unnecessary attributes through remove correalated attributes operator
		5. Do the modelling athrough cross validation and measure performance characteristics
		6. Please take note of Breakpoints as needed.


4. Ensemble_Modelling_Opcode_Ngram.xml - This process does ensemble model through stacking and advanced modelling techniques to boost the overall performance.
		Ensemble Modelling:
		1.Read the FINAL FEATURE dataset.
		2. Select the attributes.
		3. Convert Numerical Class to Polynominal/multivariate and set Role to Label for classification
		4. Remove unnecessary attributes through remove correalated attributes operator
		5. Do the Ensemble Modelling (stacking) atrough cross validation and measure performance 		characteristics
		6. Please take note of Breakpoints as needed.
		
Similar processes are used in bytes N-grams and Consolidated files for modelling		
5. Bytes_Analysis_Ngrams_bigram.xml - 
	  This process reads the bytesfiles distribution and does the following:
	  1. Process documents from files in loop and parallize:
	  (Double click Process Documents from files for subprocesses). Process document from files should point 		to the directory /repository storing the bytes files,
	  (a) Tokenize the bytes files (feed the bytes Files in bulk)
	  (b) filter the tokens based on bytes bi-grams
	  (c) Feed forward to generate attributes process
	  2. Generate attributes for the metadata file name characteristics
	  3. Select the attributes that are important (namely metdata file characteristics/n-gram) and write to 	CSV output for Feature selection and Modelling
	  
	  
6. Bytes_File_Preparation.xml
	File Preparation steps:
	1. Combine the feature set file extracted (CSV) and trainingLabels files.
	2. Set the role for class as Label and utilize the Join Operator to create a feature rich dataset.
	3. Write to a CSV for intermediate output. This file contains utmost 10800+ records for each of the training dataset.
	4. Please take are in the repository locatio used in READ CSV and RETRIEVE DATASET.
	
7. Bytes_Attributes_Modelling.xml
	File Preparation steps:
	1. Combine the feature set file extracted (CSV) and trainingLabels files.
	2. Set the role for class as Label and utilize the Join Operator to create a feature rich dataset.
	3. Write to a CSV for intermediate output. This file contains utmost 10800+ records for each of the training dataset.
	4. Please take are in the repository locatio used in READ CSV and RETRIEVE DATASET.
	
	
8.Combined_Files_Processing_(Use_as_needed).xml
    This is used for combining the feature set on bytes and ASM files N-grams.
