# Malware Prediction and Classification Using Advanced Modeling Techniques
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)

Antivirus and malware detection software’s primarily uses a signature based approach.  These software’s use a set of rules from a library, based on previously known malware and published vulnerabilities from the software manufacturer.  The rules are very specific to the vulnerability and malware, thus making them brittle and very context and malware specific.  So a new malware release still has the potential to take advantage of the same vulnerability that has already been addressed for a different malware. The Antivirus software provider releases updates to the library of rules on a periodic basis, or as critical vulnerabilities are discovered. One risk with the traditional Antivirus or malware detection software is zero-day vulnerabilities, where the hackers discover it before either the software manufacturer or the antivirus provider. 

In this implementation, we will be attempting to build a malware prediction model using Machine Learning with which we can overcome the above mentioned issues with traditional malware detection software, using the publicly available malware dataset.

# Goal
The goal of our project is that we are given a data set [Microsoft Big 2015] that contain malware data in bytes and asm files. We would like to predict the best possible match for the malware to a set of target based on the program characteristics (like Header, bytes file info, IDAT disassembled code features). The overall research hypothesis for this dataset is to parse the data, extract the features, model and then classify the malware into one of the nine categories: Ramnit, Lollipop, Kelihos_ver3, Vundo, Simda, Tracur, Kelihos_ver1, Obfuscator.ACY, Gatak.
